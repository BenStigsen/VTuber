# VTuber
Simple Python application which can be used on several platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and so on. While this can be useful and fun for content creation, I made this to help out teachers during COVID, as it can be hard and depressing to talk and listen to students while looking at static images. 

I also don't have a webcam (and probably wouldn't use it if I did), so that was also another reason for making this.

### To-Do:
Currently the focus is to extend it a bit more, simplify code and improve user-friendliness. There's also a couple of optimizations to be made. But so far there's:  
- [x] Basic animations
- [x] Basic costumes
- [x] Support for different stages
- [x] Volume specific frames (animations on specific mic volume)

These are the current features/changes I want to make:  
- [ ] Add image resizing
- [ ] Improve animation support
- [ ] Improve costume support (loading, displaying, keybinds)
- [ ] Improve stage system
